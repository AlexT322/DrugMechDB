  comment: This antibiotic inhbits beta-lactamases, enzymes that break antibiotics and therefore provide resistance to ampicillin and related beta-lacam antibiotics. Avibactam therefore is useful to treat infections caused by bacteria that are multi-resistant to β-lactam antibiotics.

The majority of cases of pyelonephritis are caused by E.coli (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyelonephritis#Causes), hence using this species in the indication path here.

  comment: The drug name available in the original file (before curation) was Rutoside. This is one of the synonyms of Rutin, which is the canonical name in DrugBank). Its mechanism of action is not well reported. Some sources have it as an aid to enhance the action of vitamin C (https://www.drugs.com/mtm/rutin.html), whereas others describe rutin (aka vitamin P) acting as a "sparing factor, which slows the oxidation of vitamin C" into dehydroascorbic acid (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroascorbic_acid).

  comment: Sclerosing solutions cause the vein to scar, forcing blood to reroute through healthier veins. The collapsed vein is reabsorbed into local tissue and eventually fades (https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sclerotherapy/about/pac-20384592).

  comment: This drug is fungistatic at concetrations up to 20 mcg/mL, and is fungicidal in vitro when used at higher concentrations. Also please note that MESH:D002181 was initially denoted as Candidal vulvovaginitis in the original xls file but the name on the MESH website, which is Candidiasis, Vulvovaginal, is the one used here for our annotation.

  comment: Diaper rash can be caused by different factors, including fungus, when it's known as diaper candidiasis. If a fungal origin is identified, the treatment is based on antifungals (e.g. clotrimazole). Therefore the original cause must be determined first as the treatments vary (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritant_diaper_dermatitis#Secondary_infections).

  comment: Other commonly used names for this drug are inositol nicotinate (CHEBI:50134), myo-inositol hexanicotinate (CHEBI:31699) and inositol hexanicotinate (CHEBI:33064)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_nicotinate). This drug is made of niacin (vitamin B3, MESH:D009525) and inositol (MESH:D007294. Note the original drug to curate for this disease was inositol but there is no evidence for it to be used as treatment unless it's bound to nicotinic acid to form inositol hexanicotinate).

  comment: This disease was named Mixed hyperlipidemia in the original file for curation but it's known as Hyperlipidemia, Familial Combined in MESH. Note there does not seem to be any evidence supporting this drug indication (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_hyperlipidemia#Treatment), so this path is hypothetic and based on the disease phenotype (i.e increased LDL and triglyceride concentrations). Other commonly used names for this drug are inositol nicotinate (CHEBI:50134), myo inositol hexanicotinate (CHEBI:31699) and inositol hexanicotinate (CHEBI:33064)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_nicotinate). This drug is made of niacin (vitamin B3, MESH:D009525) and inositol (MESH:D007294. Note the original drug to curate for this disease was inositol but there is no evidence for it to be used as treatment unless it's bound to nicotinic acid to form inositol hexanicotinate.
