  comment: The disease is also known as Indigestion as per in the original file before curation. Note that in the majority of cases no cause can be attributed to leading to the disease. When a cause can indeed be determined, the majority of cases will be due to gastroesophageal reflux and gastritis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigestion#Cause).

  comment: Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of Omeprazole, both are a proton pump inhibitor class of drug and the mechanism of action for both is similar. Weve annotated the path for the S isomer only as it seems this isomer is metabolized more slowly than omeprazole and therefore it will act for longer and more effectively (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2036.17.s1.1.x).

  comment: Tolvaptan is also known as aquaretic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaretic). Note that hyponatremia corresponds to the state where water content is relatively large for the sodium content available (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19322975/), which is possibly due to increased water reabsorption. There are different types of hyponatremia, and medications like tolvaptan should only be used in those patients with high volume or normal volume hyponatremia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia#Medications).

  comment: This disease is also known as Polycystic kidney disease adult type as per the original file. Tolvaptan is also known as aquaretic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaretic). Note that hyponatremia corresponds to the state where water content is relatively large for the sodium content available (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19322975/), which is possibly due to increased water reabsorption.

  comment: In Parkinson's disease, there is imbalance between levels of acetylcholine and dopamine, where increased levels of acetylcholine and degeneration of dopaminergic pathways are observed. Therefore, muscarinic antagonists such as biperiden block central cholinergic activity and balancing out neurotransmitters in the brain (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_antagonist#Effects). Anticholinergic drugs may also be prescribed to improve bladder dysfunction (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20370804/).

  comment: The disease is denoted as Postencephalitic parkinsonism in the original file. This disease is believed to be caused by a viral infection, leading to clinical parkinsonism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postencephalitic_parkinsonism) and anti-Parkinson drugs may be helpful in treating the symptoms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis_lethargica). For example, muscarinic antagonists can allow dopamine levels to rebalance, which can help relieve some Parkinsonian symptoms e.g. involuntary movements. Anticholinergic drugs may also be prescribed to improve bladder dysfunction (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20370804/).

  comment: There seems to be no evidence linking sulfacetamide as treatment for Amebic infection. Sulfacetamide is an antibacterial type of drug (https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D05947) and it seems the drug has some anti-inflammatory role. Since the disease could lead to inflammation and ulceration of the colon perhaps there could be an anti-inflammation hypothesis but the drug is mainly available as eye drops and lotions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfacetamide#Available_forms), and therefore unavailable to treat the intestinal tract in such formats. Note there are few amoeba species that may cause skin or eye issues (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acanthamoeba_keratitis), in which case sulfacetamide could potentially be an indication, albeit no evidence to prove this assumption has been found in databases or literature.

  comment: The action of the drug on 5-HT2 receptors is of an inverse agonist (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_agonist). The dopamine neurons are located in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system (BTO:0005591), which is a component pathway of the medial forebrain bundle (UBERON:0001910)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_forebrain_bundle#Anatomy).

  comment: The disease is also known as Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome as per the original file. Treatment with imatinib is indicated for patients who have a PDGFRA-FIP1L1 chimera, where PDGR, a tyrosine kinase (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypereosinophilic_syndrome#Diagnosis) and an oncogene (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene#Classification) is fused with FIP1L1, giving rise to a PDGFRA-FIP1L1 chimera.

  comment: The majority of dermatofibrosarcoma tumours have two genes fused due to a translocation involving the collagen gene (COL1A1) and the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The latter can be further subdivided giving rise to PDGFA, for example, which is an oncogene.
