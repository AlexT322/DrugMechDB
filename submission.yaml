  comment: Heme (MESH:D006418) and hemin (MESH:D006427) are related substances resulting from the parasite hemoglobin catabolism. Heme is bound to iron whereas hemin is the hydroxide counterpart of heme. Both are cytotoxic. Hemin is also known as hematin.

  comment: The disease is denoted as Aphthous ulcer of mouth in the original file but the name used for the path is the one seen in the MESH website. The causes for this disease are not well known (https://ada.com/conditions/aphthous-ulcers/#causes). It's important to prevent secondary infection of the ulcers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphthous_stomatitis#Medication); that's when anti-bacterial agents can be administered.

  comment: This drug may also affect GABA-mediated synaptic transmission (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00555#BE0000013). However this is rather contentious, so it has not been annotated as such in here. Besides if the drug does modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor it's a rather weak inhibition seen in animal models (yet to be determined in humans). Note that the drug could be contraindicated for treatment of seizures as it can exacerbate them (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9596203/). Finally, note that this disease is denoted as Tonic-clonic seizure in the original file but known as Seizures in MESH.

  comment: This drug may also affect GABA-mediated synaptic transmission as listed by DrugBank (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00555#BE0000013). However, this is contentious and if the drug does modulate GABA it's not known whether it is as agonist or antagonist due to conflicting data (at best it would be a weak modulation seen in animal models only). Note that the drug could be contraindicated for treatment of seizures as it can exacerbate them, specially the myoclonic type (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9596203/).

  comment: Muscarinic receptor antagonists (also known as anticholinergics) seem to be used in patients with Schizophrenia to alleviate motor side effects caused by first-generation antipsychotics. However these antagonists do seem to lead to cognitive dysfunction in healthy controls. So whether these muscarinic receptors should be positively or negatively regulated in schizophrenia is a matter of debate (see https://www.nature.com/articles/4001924 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3726271/). In addition, some suggest that that schizophrenia involves an overactivation of cholinergic neurons, which could provide cholinergic input to dopaminergic neurons. The dopamine neurons are located in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system (BTO:0005591), which is a component pathway of the medial forebrain bundle (UBERON:0001910). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_forebrain_bundle#Anatomy for more details.

  comment: This condition does not seem to be a true ocular allergic reaction, rather caused by repeated mechanical irritation of the conjunctiva (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_conjunctivitis#Giant_papillary_conjunctivitis). So the treatment with cromoglicic acid may not be needed/useful at all but interruption of contact lens wearing.

  comment: This drug is used in combination with dalfopristin. Both interfere with the bacterial protein synthesis, at different stages of the translation. Quinupristin inhibits the late phase of protein synthesis, whereas dalfopristin inhibits the early phase of protein synthesis in the bacterial ribosome. In combination, both drugs are more effective than each used individually (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01369#description).

  comment: The activation of Atrial natriuretic peptide receptor 1 has been observed in vitro (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12890708/) and it's reported in DrugBank whereas ChEMBL favours the Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase route. Also note that when the drug is admnistered at low doses, it dilates veins and reduces the volume of blood in the heart after filling (this is supposedly the main mechanism of action). At higher doses, it dilates arteries as well.

  comment: There appears to be no connection between Niacin deficiency and nicotine. Although niacin and nicotine are somehow related (nicotine can turn into nicotinic acid via oxidation), nicotine may not be able to replace niacin as treatment for Niacin deficiency. Actually nicotine could compete with niacin for binding sites in the enzymes necessary for vitamin B3 metabolism, and therefore would decrease the amount of B3 available for the cells.

  comment: The hypotensive effects of chlorothiazide and other thiazides are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2904515/#S1title). The exact mechanism is yet not fully understood.
