  comment: Other commonly used names for this drug are inositol nicotinate (CHEBI:50134), myo-inositol hexanicotinate (CHEBI:31699) and inositol hexanicotinate (CHEBI:33064)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_nicotinate). This drug is made of niacin (vitamin B3, MESH:D009525) and inositol (MESH:D007294. Note the original drug to curate for this disease was inositol but there is no evidence for it to be used as treatment unless it's bound to nicotinic acid to form inositol hexanicotinate.
