  comments: Epinephrine can widen the bronchial tubes (it's a bronchodilator). Therefore it seems counterintuitive to use a bronchodilator for a condition - bronchiectasis - characterised by parts of the lungs being permanently enlarged. There does seems to be some data that does support the usage of bronchodilator in some - but not all - bronchiectasis patients. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiectasis#cite_note-78). Dilating the airways could be beneficial during sudden worsening of the condition, but there are no studies to determine the effectiveness of this type of drug.

  comments: Brochitis is characterised by inflammation and bronchodilators will only help with some of the symptoms by relaxing and opening the air passages in the lungs. Thereâ€™s little evidence to support the use of beta-2 agonists in adults with acute bronchitis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7078572/) although it can help with the sneezing.

  comments: The use of bronchodilators does not seem to improve the condition per se as it does for other respiratory conditions such as asthma for example. The benefit is rather small (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease#Bronchodilators).

  comments: Many other members of the sodium channel protein alpha unit family (MESH:D061566 or CHEMBL:2331043) could also be targets for this drug, presumably through the same MoA, according to ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound_report_card/CHEMBL1201754/) and Pharos (https://pharos.nih.gov/ligands/rufinamide).

  comments: This drug seems to have mixed effects in the dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline systems (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2869188/), suggesting it can compensate for deficits in disease and in aging while preventing the pathological effects that result from excessive activity in these systems in normal individuals. This drug is contraindicated in patients who have psychosis, acute or chronic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergoloid#Contraindications).

  comments: This drug could potentially modulate UniProt:P43115 as it has little selectivity. However, the action upon activing this target would be vasoconstriction, which would be contraindicated in Pulmonary arterial hypertension. This could explain the hypertension adverse event reported in https://www.targetvalidation.org/summary?drug=CHEMBL494. DrugBank has the phosphodiesterase gene family as possible targets for this drug but this is based on experiments where Iloprost was used in combination with phosphodiesterase inhibitors. So, Iloprost on its own does not modulate phosphodiesterases.
