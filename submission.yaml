  comment: L-type calcium channels are modulated by the adrenergic nervous system, hence betaxolol could indirectly modulate L calcium channels, decreasing heart rate and contraction, ultimately decreasing high blood pressure (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-type_calcium_channel#Inhibition_and_modulation).

  comment: The use of progesterone, progestin and similar compounds may not be superior to placebo in reducing premenstrual symptoms judging from the results of the majority of controlled trials (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7791258/). Also note that it is generally agreed that neither a deficiency nor excess in progesterone/progestin levels is etiologically relevant to the disorder (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16650465/). It's largelly accepted that SSRIs as better treatment and should be the first attempt for treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

  comment: The disease is denoted Menopausal flushing in the original file. Note that a combination therapy of estradiol and drospirenone would be more effective at reducing the frequency of hot flushes and other menopausal symptoms, than a mono-therapy relying on progestin only. Also, since many progestogens have off-target effects including estrogenic effects, the improvement in hot flashes maybe due to the drug binding to estrogen receptors instead. Note the term Vasomotor System (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasomotor_center) does not seem to be represented in other ontologies.

The drug is metabolized by nitoreductases (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2020/213464s000lbl.pdf) rather than nitoreductases being the target of this drug (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB11820#BE0010011).

  comment: DrugBank and ChEMBL seem to disagree on the target of this drug (UniProt:P43088 in ChEMBL, UniProt:P34995 in DrugBank). Hence using a more generic term (IPR008365) to encompass both entries from those two databases.

  comment: Note that this drug is used as a support to the treatment of chronic alcoholism by producing an acute sensitivity to ethanol (as part of an avoidance therapy for alcohol abuse). It's been suggested that disulfiram itself is unlikely responsible for the enzyme inactivation in vivo; several active metabolites of the drug, especially diethylthiomethylcarbamate, inhibits the enzyme in vitro (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3117#section=Mechanism-of-Action).

  comment: Camphor is analgesic (https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?cpd:C00808). The activation of members of the transient receptor ion channel protein family applications lead to desensitization, which in turn contributes to the analgesic effects of camphor after prolonged/repeated applications (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33804078/).
