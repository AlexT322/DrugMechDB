  comments: Heme (MESH:D006418) and hemin (MESH:D006427) are related substances resulting from the parasite hemoglobin catabolism. Heme is bound to iron whereas hemin is the hydroxide counterpart of heme. Both are cytotoxic. Hemin is also known as hematin.

  comments: The disease is denoted as Aphthous ulcer of mouth in the original file but the name used for the path is the one seen in the MESH website. The causes for this disease are not well known (https://ada.com/conditions/aphthous-ulcers/#causes). It's important to prevent secondary infection of the ulcers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphthous_stomatitis#Medication); that's when anti-bacterial agents can be administered.

  comments: This drug may also affect GABA-mediated synaptic transmission (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00555#BE0000013). However this is rather contentious, so it has not been annotated as such in here. Besides if the drug does modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor it's a rather weak inhibition seen in animal models (yet to be determined in humans). Note that the drug could be contraindicated for treatment of seizures as it can exacerbate them (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9596203/). Finally, note that this disease is denoted as Tonic-clonic seizure in the original file but known as Seizures in MESH.

  comments: This drug may also affect GABA-mediated synaptic transmission (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00555#BE0000013). However this is rather contentious, so it has not been annotated as such in here. Besides if the drug does inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor it's a rather weak inhibition seen in animal models (yet to be determined in humans). Note that the drug could be contraindicated for treatment of seizures as it can exacerbate them, specially the myoclonic type (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9596203/). Finally, this disease is denoted as Tonic-clonic seizure in the original file but known as Seizures in MESH.

  comments: This drug may also affect GABA-mediated synaptic transmission as listed by DrugBank (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00555#BE0000013). However, this is contentious and if the drug does modulate GABA it's not known whether it is as agonist or antagonist due to conflicting data (at best it would be a weak modulation seen in animal models only). Note that the drug could be contraindicated for treatment of seizures as it can exacerbate them, specially the myoclonic type (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9596203/). Finally, this disease is denoted as Simple partial seizure in the original file but known as Epilepsies, Partial in MESH.
