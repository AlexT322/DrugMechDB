  comments: MESH:C000608451 may have been deprecated; no longer in MESH. The disease is denotated as Indigestion in the original file before curation. Note that the majority of cases no cause can be attributed to leading to the disease. When a cause can indeed be determined, the majority of cases will be due to gastroesophageal reflux and gastritis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigestion#Cause).

  comments: Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of Omeprazole, both are a proton pump inhibitor class of drug and the mechanism of action for both is similar. Weve annotated the path for the S isomer only as it seems this isomer is metabolized more slowly than omeprazole and therefore it will act for longer and more effectively (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2036.17.s1.1.x).

  comments: Tolvaptan is also known as aquaretic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaretic). Note that hyponatremia corresponds to the state where water content is relatively large for the sodium content available (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19322975/), which is possibly due to increased water reabsorption. There are different types of hyponatremia, and medications like tolvaptan should only be used in those patients with high volume or normal volume hyponatremia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia#Medications).

  comments: This disease is denoted as Polycystic kidney disease adult type in the original file. Tolvaptan is also known as aquaretic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaretic). Note that hyponatremia corresponds to the state where water content is relatively large for the sodium content available (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19322975/), which is possibly due to increased water reabsorption.

  comments: In Parkinson's disease, there is imbalance between levels of acetylcholine and dopamine, where increased levels of acetylcholine and degeneration of dopaminergic pathways are observed. Therefore, muscarinic antagonists such as biperiden block central cholinergic activity and balancing out neurotransmitters in the brain (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_antagonist#Effects). Anticholinergic drugs may also be prescribed to improve bladder dysfunction (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20370804/).

  comments: The disease is denoted as Postencephalitic parkinsonism in the original file. This disease is believed to be caused by a viral infection, leading to clinical parkinsonism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postencephalitic_parkinsonism) and anti-Parkinson drugs may be helpful in treating the symptoms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis_lethargica). For example, muscarinic antagonists can allow dopamine levels to rebalance, which can help relieve some Parkinsonian symptoms e.g. involuntary movements. Anticholinergic drugs may also be prescribed to improve bladder dysfunction (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20370804/).
