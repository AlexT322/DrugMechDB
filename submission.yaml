  comments: The disease, specially the acute form, is mainly caused by infection (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterocolitis#Cause), leading to inflammation. So in addition to treating the symptoms (such as spams and GI secretions), antibiotics, anti-virals etc may be needed for treatment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterocolitis#Treatment).

  comments: In Parkinson's disease, there is imbalance between levels of acetylcholine and dopamine, where increased levels of acetylcholine and degeneration of dopaminergic pathways are observed. Therefore, muscarinic antagonists block central cholinergic activity and balance out neurotransmitters in the brain (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_antagonist#Effects). Anticholinergic drugs may also be prescribed to improve bladder dysfunction (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20370804/).

  comments: The the antiseizure mechanism of action based on the voltage sodium channels is not a consensus (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eslicarbazepine_acetate#Mechanism_of_action). The drug could also bind to calcium channels (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09119#mechanism-of-action). Note that the protein target listed in DrugBank (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09119#BE0005793) does not seem to be involved in epilepsy, but rather in inflammation and pain.

  comments: This disease is denoted as Disorder of lung in the original file. Note this disease name is a very generic term, that could encompass any diseases of the lungs, including neoplasms, infectious diseases (e.g. tuberculosis) and rare diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis) for which theophylline may not have any therapeutic benefit at all. Therefore, this annotation is done for all lung diseases that could be indications for this drug to encompass diseases that are similar to asthma, bronchitis, COPD and alike.

  comments: The disease is denoted Deep venous thrombosis in the original file as per DrugCentral. Note that among the original MESH IDs for this drug one of them seems to have been deprecated (MESH:C438268) whereas the other (MESH:C049714) is for a compound where no evidence has been found to be related to fondaparinux.
