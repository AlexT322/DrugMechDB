Comment: Muscarinic receptor antagonists (also known as anticholinergics) seem to be used in patients with Schizophrenia to alleviate motor side effects caused by first-generation antipsychotics. However these antagonists do seem to lead to cognitive dysfunction in healthy controls. So whether these muscarinic receptors should be positively or negatively regulated in schizophrenia is a matter of debate (see [https://www.nature.com/articles/4001924](https://www.nature.com/articles/4001924) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3726271/).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3726271/).) In addition, some suggest that that schizophrenia involves an overactivation of cholinergic neurons, which could provide cholinergic input to dopaminergic neurons. The dopamine neurons are located in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system (BTO:0005591), which is a component pathway of the medial forebrain bundle (UBERON:0001910). See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_forebrain_bundle#Anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_forebrain_bundle#Anatomy) for more details.
