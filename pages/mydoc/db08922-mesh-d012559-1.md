Comment: The action of the drug on 5-HT2 receptors is of an inverse agonist (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_agonist). The dopamine neurons are located in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system (BTO:0005591), which is a component pathway of the medial forebrain bundle (UBERON:0001910)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_forebrain_bundle#Anatomy).
