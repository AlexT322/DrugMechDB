Comment: The disease is also known as Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome as per the original file. Treatment with imatinib is indicated for patients who have a PDGFRA-FIP1L1 chimera, where PDGR, a tyrosine kinase (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypereosinophilic_syndrome#Diagnosis) and an oncogene (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene#Classification) is fused with FIP1L1, giving rise to a PDGFRA-FIP1L1 chimera.
