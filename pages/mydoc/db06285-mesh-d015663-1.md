Comment: A right balance needs to be struck for normal bone formation, which involved bone resorption, the breaking down of bone tissue. This drug is actually a portion of the physiologically procuded hormone, PTH, which does increase bone resorption. So the right amount of drug (and frequency) is needed to be achieved to have a net effect of stimulating new bone formation therefore preventing osteoporosis.
