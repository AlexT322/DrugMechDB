Comment: Orphenadrine works centrally and interferes with reflex pathways for pain and skeletal muscle contraction. The precise mechanism of action of orphenadrine is not known, but it appears to indirectly relieve muscle spasm through central atropine-like effects, although its mild antihistaminic activity may have a role.
