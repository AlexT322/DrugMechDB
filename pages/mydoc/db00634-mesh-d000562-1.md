Comment: There seems to be no evidence linking sulfacetamide as treatment for Amebic infection. Sulfacetamide is an antibacterial type of drug (https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D05947) and it seems the drug has some anti-inflammatory role. Since the disease could lead to inflammation and ulceration of the colon perhaps there could be an anti-inflammation hypothesis but the drug is mainly available as eye drops and lotions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfacetamide#Available_forms), and therefore unavailable to treat the intestinal tract in such formats. Note there are few amoeba species that may cause skin or eye issues (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acanthamoeba_keratitis), in which case sulfacetamide could potentially be an indication, albeit no evidence to prove this assumption has been found in databases or literature.
