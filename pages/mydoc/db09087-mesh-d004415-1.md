Comment: The disease is also known as Indigestion as per in the original file before curation. Note that in the majority of cases no cause can be attributed to leading to the disease. When a cause can indeed be determined, the majority of cases will be due to gastroesophageal reflux and gastritis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigestion#Cause).
