Comment: Octreotide has antiproliferative effects and it is used in treating neuroendocrine tumours including carcinoid tumours. Octreotide improves symptoms of carcinoid syndrome such as diarrhoea and flushing [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983100/.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983100/.) Octreotide is also used in imaging method called octreoscan where indium-111 labelled octreotide is used in scintigraphy for detecting tumors expressing somatostatin receptors [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoid_syndrome#Imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoid_syndrome#Imaging)
