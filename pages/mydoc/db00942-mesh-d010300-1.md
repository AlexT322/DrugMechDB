Comment: In Parkinson's disease, there is imbalance between levels of acetylcholine and dopamine, where increased levels of acetylcholine and degeneration of dopaminergic pathways are observed. Therefore, muscarinic antagonists block central cholinergic activity and balance out neurotransmitters in the brain (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_antagonist#Effects). Anticholinergic drugs may also be prescribed to improve bladder dysfunction (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20370804/).
