Comment: The antiseizure mechanism of action based on the voltage sodium channels is not a consensus (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eslicarbazepine_acetate#Mechanism_of_action). The drug could also bind to calcium channels (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09119#mechanism-of-action). Note that the protein target listed in DrugBank (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09119#BE0005793) does not seem to be involved in epilepsy, but rather in inflammation and pain.
