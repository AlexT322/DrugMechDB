Comment: Setiptiline is considered a weak inhibitor of norepinephrine reuptake but I could not find evidence for this drug modulating the (nore)epinephrine uptake by Q7RTT9 or P23975. These putative mechanism has been observed in vitro/model organisms studies and is on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setiptiline#Pharmacodynamics) but not on DrugBank or ChEMBL for example.
