Comment: This drug seems to have mixed effects in the dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline systems (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2869188/), suggesting it can compensate for deficits in disease and in aging while preventing the pathological effects that result from excessive activity in these systems in normal individuals. This drug is contraindicated in patients who have psychosis, acute or chronic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergoloid#Contraindications).
