Comment: The cause of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's Disease is not fully understood. It's khown that acetylcholine producing neurons degenerate and it's believed that this cholinergic loss is correlated with cognitive impairment and a density of amyloid plaques (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/9651#section=Mechanism-of-Action).
