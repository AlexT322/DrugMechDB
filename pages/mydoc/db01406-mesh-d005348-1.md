## Relationships

|---------|-----------|---------|
| Subject | Predicate | Object  |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Danazol | DECREASES ACTIVITY OF | Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor |
| Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor | INCREASES ABUNDANCE OF | Gonadotropins, Pituitary |
| Gonadotropins, Pituitary | POSITIVELY REGULATES | Estrogen Biosynthetic Process |
| Estrogen Biosynthetic Process | INCREASES ABUNDANCE OF | Estrogens |
| Estrogens | POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH | Fibrocystic Breast Changes |
|---------|-----------|---------|

Comment: In fibrocystic breast disease, the exact mechanism of action of danazol is unknown, but may be related to suppressed estrogenic stimulation as a result of decreased ovarian production of estrogen.
