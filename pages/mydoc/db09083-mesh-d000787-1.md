Comment: Both UniProt:Q9UL51 and UniProt:Q9Y3Q4 are slow sodium channels, also known as If channels, where 'f' stands for funny, as per the unusual properties compared with other current systems known at the time of their discovery. Note that out of the two proteins, UniProt:Q9Y3Q4 is the most highly expressed in sinoatrial node myocytes (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17999560/).
