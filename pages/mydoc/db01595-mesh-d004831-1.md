Comment: The anticonvulsant properties of nitrazepam and other benzodiazepines may be in part or entirely due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium  channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrazepam#Pharmacology), so both classes of targets have been annotated here. Although the parmachological action on UniProt:P35498 is unknown (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01595#BE0000141) it's believed that reduced sodium currents due to mutations in the gene that codes for UniProt:P35498 may cause hyper-excitability in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, which would lead to seizures. In mouse models, a dramatic loss of sodium current in hippocampal GABAergic inhibitory interneurons would mean hypofunction of inhibitory circuits, leading to hyperexcitability of neuronal networks and result in epilepsy seizures (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16921370/).
