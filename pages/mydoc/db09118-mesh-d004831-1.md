Comment: A working hypothesis for a mode of action is that reduced metabolism weakens homeostatic control of intracellular and extracellular ionic concentrations, leading to hyperexcitability and seizure. However it's not known the exact mechanisms by which (A) glucose deprivation cause ionic imbalance and at the same time sustain neuronal hyperexcitability (i.e., a status associated with higher metabolic demands); and (B) which reduced glucose metabolism can generate seizures while also being anticonvulsant (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29143800/).
