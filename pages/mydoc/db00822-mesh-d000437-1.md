Comment: Note that this drug is used as a support to the treatment of chronic alcoholism by producing an acute sensitivity to ethanol (as part of an avoidance therapy for alcohol abuse). It's been suggested that disulfiram itself is unlikely responsible for the enzyme inactivation in vivo; several active metabolites of the drug, especially diethylthiomethylcarbamate, inhibits the enzyme in vitro (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3117#section=Mechanism-of-Action).
