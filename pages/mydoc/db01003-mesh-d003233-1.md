Comment: This condition does not seem to be a true ocular allergic reaction, rather caused by repeated mechanical irritation of the conjunctiva (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_conjunctivitis#Giant_papillary_conjunctivitis). So the treatment with cromoglicic acid may not be needed/useful at all but interruption of contact lens wearing.
