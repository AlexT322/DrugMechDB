Comment: Diphenoxylic acid (or difenoxin) is the pharmacologically active metabolite of diphenoxylate (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3682841/), being 5 times more potent (https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/ld/understanding-the-chemical-basis-of-drug-stability-and-degradation). Diphenoxylate is rapidly metabolized to difenoxin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphenoxylate#Pharmacology). It's been suggested that difenoxin may regulate non-opioid receptor pathways as well (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01501#mechanism-of-action).
