Comment: This drug may also affect GABA-mediated synaptic transmission (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00555#BE0000013). However this is rather contentious, so it has not been annotated as such in here. Besides if the drug does inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor it's a rather weak inhibition seen in animal models (yet to be determined in humans). Note that the drug could be contraindicated for treatment of seizures as it can exacerbate them, specially the myoclonic type (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9596203/). Finally, this disease is denoted as Tonic-clonic seizure in the original file but known as Seizures in MESH.
