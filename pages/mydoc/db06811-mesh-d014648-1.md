Comment: Polidocanol is a sclerosing agent indicated to treat uncomplicated spider veins. Sclerosing solutions cause the vein to scar, forcing blood to reroute through healthier veins. The collapsed vein is reabsorbed into local tissue and eventually fades (https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sclerotherapy/about/pac-20384592).
