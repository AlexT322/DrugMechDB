Comment: Levosimendan has not been approved for use in the U.S. or Canada.  It has been reported that levosimendan may act preferentially as a Ca2+ sensitizer at lower concentrations, whereas at higher concentrations its action as a PDE-III inhibitor becomes more prominent in experimental animals and humans.
