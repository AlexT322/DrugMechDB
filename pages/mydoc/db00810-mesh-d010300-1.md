Comment: In Parkinson's disease, there is imbalance between levels of acetylcholine and dopamine, where increased levels of acetylcholine and degeneration of dopaminergic pathways are observed. Therefore, muscarinic antagonists such as biperiden block central cholinergic activity and balancing out neurotransmitters in the brain (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_antagonist#Effects). Anticholinergic drugs may also be prescribed to improve bladder dysfunction (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20370804/).
