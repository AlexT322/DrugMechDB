Comment: The disease, specially the acute form, is mainly caused by infection (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterocolitis#Cause), leading to inflammation. So in addition to treating the symptoms (such as spams and GI secretions), antibiotics, anti-virals etc may be needed for treatment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterocolitis#Treatment).
